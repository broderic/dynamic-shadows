Misc. Stuff
=====================
+ handle cygwin related issues
  * strcasecmp issues
  * some issues with an unknown __imp___iob token when linking. 
    * appears to be from using fprintf?
  * jpeg stuff is included by hand. Can't use <jpeg.h>
  * stuff in ctype.h seems to give problems. Got around this
    by writing my own isspace() routine.
  * timer issues
  * apparently no 'scandir' function... 

+ handle command-line arguments by passing to console 
+ add cvars for default viewport dimensions, fov, nearplane, farplane, etc.
+ vid restart from console

+ read .pak files instead of needing them to be unzipped

Drawing stuff
======================
* draw_wireframe interferes with console... >:@
+ draw md3 models with shader
+ anisotropic filtering
+ hardware gamma correction
* shader-driven sky
+ use multitexturing when drawing shaders
* turn patches into a single mesh
+ deformVertexes
+ alphaGen
# some texture names that appear in bsp or shader files have
  different capitalization than their filenames;

+ cull faces not visible to world
  # gives smaller silhouette
  # not a serious issue


Shadow Volumes:
=====================
* MAKE IT WORK WITH SHADERS
+ spot lights for shadow volumes
* speed up!

Shadow Mapping:
=====================
* MAKE IT WORK WITH SHADERS!
